# @quiltt/core

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@quiltt%2Fcore.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@quiltt%2Fcore)
[![CI](https://github.com/quiltt/quiltt-js/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/quiltt/quiltt-js/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

`@quiltt/core` provides essential primitives for building Javascript-based applications with Quiltt. It provides an Auth API client and modules for handling JSON Web Tokens (JWT), observables, storage management, timeouts, API handling, and Typescript types.

This package is used by both [`@quiltt/react`](../react#readme) and [`@quiltt/react-native`](../react-native#readme). If you bundle it separately, we recommend keeping versions in sync to avoid issues with mismatched dependencies.

For general project information and contributing guidelines, see the [main repository README](../../README.md).

## Install

With `npm`:

```shell
npm install @quiltt/core
```

With `yarn`:

```shell
yarn add @quiltt/core
```

With `pnpm`:

```shell
pnpm add @quiltt/core
```

## Auth API Client

The Auth API is used by the Quiltt Connector under the hood and can be used to perform basic operations on your Session tokens. Pull requests to extend the API to handle server-side authentication are welcome.

```ts
// Import Auth API client
import { AuthAPI } from '@quiltt/core'

// Set up client instance
const auth = new AuthAPI()

// Check if a Session token is valid
await auth.ping('{SESSION_TOKEN}')

// Revoke a Session token
await auth.revoke('{SESSION_TOKEN}')
```

## Modules

You can import from the main entry or use subpath imports for better tree-shaking.

```ts
import { AuthAPI } from '@quiltt/core'
import { JsonWebTokenParse } from '@quiltt/core/auth'
import { Observable } from '@quiltt/core/observables'
import { Timeoutable } from '@quiltt/core/timing'
import { Storage } from '@quiltt/core/storage'
import { endpointAuth } from '@quiltt/core/config'
```

### Auth (JsonWebToken)

The `JsonWebToken` module provides functionality related to JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It includes methods for generating, signing, and verifying JWTs. With this module, you can easily handle authentication and secure communication in your applications.

### Observables

The `Observable` module implements the Observable pattern, allowing you to create and manage observable streams of data. It provides a powerful toolset for working with asynchronous events and data streams, enabling you to build reactive and event-driven applications.

### Storage

The `Storage` module offers convenient wrappers and abstractions for working with different types of storage, such as local storage or session storage. It simplifies the process of storing and retrieving data in a secure and efficient manner.

### Timing

The `Timeoutable` module provides utilities for handling timeouts and delays in your application. It allows you to schedule and manage timeouts, ensuring precise control over time-sensitive operations.

### API

The `api` module contains components and functions related to handling APIs. It offers a set of tools for making API requests, managing GraphQL subscriptions, and interacting with remote services.

### Types

The `types` module provides a collection of TypeScript type definitions and interfaces that are used throughout the `@quiltt/core` library. These types ensure type safety and provide a solid foundation for building robust applications.

## Usage

```javascript
import { AuthAPI } from '@quiltt/core'
import { JsonWebTokenParse } from '@quiltt/core/auth'
import { Observable } from '@quiltt/core/observables'
import { Storage } from '@quiltt/core/storage'
import { Timeoutable } from '@quiltt/core/timing'

// Example usage of the library modules
// ...
```

## Typescript support

`@quiltt/core` is written in Typescript and ships with its own type definitions.
