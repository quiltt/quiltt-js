# Welcome to Quiltt's example Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Development

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. If you don't have it installed, you can follow the instructions [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

### Get started

1. Install dependencies

   yarn install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   Create a new `.env` file at the root of the project, then copy the contents of `.env.example` into it. Replace the placeholder values with the proper values you can get from the Quiltt Dashboard.

   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Start the app
