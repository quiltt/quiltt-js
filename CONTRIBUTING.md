- **Provide a clear and detailed explanation** of the feature or improvement you want to see. Include examples of how it would function ideally.

### Submitting Changes

If you're ready to submit a code change:

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally on your machine.
3. **Create a branch** for your changes. Use a clear and descriptive name for the branch.
4. **Make your changes.** Stick to the coding standards and guidelines provided. Write tests for your changes if applicable.
5. **Create a changeset** by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. This documents your changes for the release notes. See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for more details.
6. **Commit your changes.** Use clear and descriptive commit messages. Include the generated changeset file.
7. **Push your changes** to your fork on GitHub.
8. **Submit a pull request** against the `main` branch of `quiltt-js`. Provide a clear description of the changes and any relevant issue numbers.

#### Code Review Process

After you submit your pull request, it will be reviewed by the maintainers. This process helps to ensure the highest quality and maintainability of the code. During the review, you might receive feedback and requests for changes to your submissions. This is a normal part of the review process, so please be open to discussion and modifications.
